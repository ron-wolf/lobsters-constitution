# The Lobsters Constitution

## What Lobsters Is
Lobsters is a wonderful link aggregator / discussion forum for people working in software engineering–related fields to discuss and share ideas relevant to our industry practices and culture. It is a place to teach and learn, and a place to compare notes on how to do things.

The posts we make should be:

* …to learn about new programming and engineering techniques and ideas 
* …to learn about weird software and hardware hacks (in the old sense of the term)
* …to learn about computer science and software engineering
* …to learn about mathematics, statistics, and science, beyond the level of popsci clickbait
* …to learn about software and hardware history
* …for professionals to compare war stories and employment information/opportunities
* …for members to show other members their cool hacks and software projects (*not* products)
* …to reflect on the philosophy and culture of engineering and programming and how they relate to our professions
* …to debate with other members on any of the above and to be able to do so civilly and in depth

## What Lobsters *Is Not*
The things Lobsters *is not* are even more important. Lobsters *is not* a place:

* …for advertising or promoting new products and services from non- or new members
* …for posting things whose value derives mainly from novelty (read: *news in most forms*)
* …for posting political or politically-minded articles
* …for posting things whose value derives from outrage (read: *most stories of unfairness or inequality*)
* …for rabble-rousing or social calls-to-action
* …for making empty comments and stupid/low-effort jokes
* …for insulting or making ad-hominem attacks against other members
* …for soliciting technical support (read: *questions you’d ask on Stack Overflow*)

Often, these are not necessarily bad; they are just not within the scope of our community.

## Code of Conduct

### Submission guidelines
* Submissions should be on topic and fit an appropriate tag(s). If a tag doesn’t fit, the link might not be appropriate to post on Lobsters.
* Use original titles sans extraneous bits on submissions—leave editorializing to suggestions. For content older than a few years, suffix the title with the year of publication in parens.
* Add context to submissions when it is not clear from the title.
* Do not submit spam or low-value articles.
* Similar submissions may be merged by mods. Message a mod or comment on it if you think a submission should be merged.
* For discussion stories, consider asking open-ended questions over ones with concrete solutions.
* Only flag submissions when they are outside the realm of the topic at hand—never out of disagreement.
* Use the “suggest” link to fix any title or tag errors you see in a submission.

### Discussion/commenting guidelines
* Treat people with respect and assume good faith.
* In discussions, providing sources and relevant articles is encouraged.
* Don’t downvote due to mere disagreement. Downvote for uncivil behaviour or factual inaccuracy.
* Don’t insult others with ad-hominem attacks, slurs, or personal attacks.
* Don’t harass, intimidate, dox, troll, or spam.
* Don’t make comments that discriminate based on race, sex, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, gender identity, faith or lack thereof, cultural/national/ethnic identity or origin, or family status.
* Don’t derail threads with off-topic or irrelevant comments.
* Don’t make low-effort comments (jokes, puns, “me-toos”).
* Don’t be afraid to agree to disagree and move on.
* Don’t get obsessed over karma. It’s just a number.

These rules encourage polite behaviour when talking with other community members. Mods may take action in some cases, but as a community member *you* have a duty to maintain civility by contributing to discussions and downvoting problematic comments.

### When to contact mods
Moderators are shown usernames and scores for every comment, so if you feel that someone is specifically downvoting your submissions due to a grudge, message a moderator to look into it.

### IRC guidelines
The same as the discussion guidelines, though IRC is more relaxed in tone and scope than the site. Off-topic banter is acceptable.

### Bans
In the event that someone needs to be removed from the community for a rule violation (spamming or harassing other users, for instance), the moderation team will ban the user, and the action will appear publicly on the [moderation log](https://lobste.rs/moderations) with the reason. The banned user’s comment will appear as deleted.

Banning is at the discretion of the moderation team. In serious incidents such as voting rings, sockpuppets, and other serious rule violations, the moderators can ban up and down the invite tree as deemed necessary.

## F. A. Q.

### Where can I get an invite?
If you don’t know a community member to ask, you can check the [chat](https://lobste.rs/chat), which is frequented by Lobsters members. Keep in mind that they may ask you to provide links to your online presence.

### What is a “low-value” article?
A low-value article:

* …is unverifiable or not clearly worded
* …has an undisclosed but strong bias
* …is rehashing or parroting information readily found elsewhere
* …lacks technical content
* …is clickbait or a link to a social media website
* …links to another link aggregator such as Reddit or Hacker News
* …states opinions without supporting facts or analysis
* …is a meme
* …is a reactionary response (to some other article/event) exemplifying a lack of strong knowledge about the subject

Some example low-value sources are Business Insider, Techcrunch, Vice Motherboard, and Infowars. Other link aggregators like Reddit and Hacker News do not count as high-quality sources.

In general, consider the Wikipedia [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources#Questionable_and_self-published_sources) for such things:

> “publications expressing views that are widely acknowledged as extremist, that are promotional in nature, or that rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions.”

### What consitututes a spam submission? 
* Repetitive posts related to a single topic, in some cases
* Excessive promotion of a product or service, either your own or your employer’s
* Obvious spam—the kind of thing you’d see in your junk mail folder
* Off-topic submissions

Note that these submissions will be given less slack when made by new accounts: we want to discourage people from joining just to sell product.

### What are some examples of tags?
* If a post discusses the Lobsters community or policies, use the `meta` tag.
* If a post is primarily humorous in nature, use the `satire` tag.
* If a post is aggressive or angry, use the `rant` tag.
* If a post involves a software release, new library, or distro announcement, use the `release` tag.
* If a post involves containers, consider the `virtualization` or `devops` tag.
* If a post involves F# programming, use the `ml` and `dotnet` tags in combination.
* If a post is announcing a new service, consumer product, or SEO tool, it probably shouldn’t be here.

To see all tags go to [here](http://lobste.rs/tags).

### How do I create a tag that doesn’t exist?
If a tag doesn’t exist, create a meta discussion for getting that tag evaluated by the community. Include the rationale for creating the tag, as well as links to stories that could use the tag. Controversial topics that users would like to filter are good candidates, as are programming languages and high-level general concepts<!-- ? -->. If the moderators don’t apply the tag to the back catalogue of posts, then you can use a suggestion to do so.

### Does referencing employment information count as doxing?
If a person’s employer is relevant to their expertise or contextual background, *and is public knowledge*, they’re fair game to bring up.

### How can I judge a potential invitee’s reputation?
For technical ability, consider looking at:

* …public code repositories and open source contributions (e.g., a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket profile)
* …a personal website
* …some other evidence of technical knowledge that they can share (e.g., Instagram of projects)

You might want to look at how they’ve conducted themselves in other communities like Hacker News or Reddit. Ask yourself whether you want to see that kind of behaviour here.
